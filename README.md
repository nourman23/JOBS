**React JS** app built using the Job API and Material-UI styling. You can search for your first or next job among all the listed jobs, use filters to narrow your results and be specific to what you are looking for.

This project took me around four days to build, styling part took most time because I used Material UI for the first time.

### Features

- Fully responsive
- Can apply different filters to narrow search results
- Takes advantage of React Hooks like 'useContext, useEffect, useState , UseNavigate' .

### Built with

- Axios :- For interacting with the API.
- Markdown to JSX :- For converting received Markdown response into HTML.
- Material-UI & Tailwind & react Bootstrap:- For styling the UI & UX.
