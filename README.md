**React JS** app built using the Job API and Material-UI styling. You can search for your first or next job among all the listed jobs,logged in user can save job for later and find it in the profile, use filters to narrow your results and be specific to what you are looking for.

This project took me around four days to build, styling part took most time because I used Material UI for the first time.
